# Catsgram
> A web application where detects whether an image uploaded by a user contains a picture of a cat. In an administrative back-end area, a website's basic structure (i.e., users, posts, themes) can be dynamically created and modified by only authorized users with the appropriate permissions. The front-end site will be viewable by all users including guests, but users can register and on subsequent visits log in in order to be able to contribute and make some changes to feed content.

## General Information
It was my final assignment for web application programming. I received a mark of 100%, with a final course mark of 98%.
I deployed this application using Heroku and AWS Relational Database Service. However, I could not use AWS RDS anymore because I was using a school account. So, I used ClearDB to build my app using native MySQL databases instead. In class, I used Laravel version 6 and PHP 7 but upgraded Laravel version to 8 and PHP version to 8.1 and added image uploading, comments functionalities, and a third party API to detect cat's images after the course ended.

- TypeScript - version 5.0.4
- JavaScript
- Jest - version 29.5.0
