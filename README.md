# Quotes App
> A web application where users can post quotes. In an administrative back-end area, a website's basic structure (i.e., users, posts, themes) can be dynamically created and modified by only authorized users with the appropriate permissions. The front-end site will be viewable by all users including guests, but users can register and on subsequent visits log in in order to be able to contribute and make some changes to feed content.

## General Information
It was my final assignment for web application programming. I received a mark of 100%, with a final course mark of 98%.
I deployed this application using Heroku and AWS Relational Database Service. However, I could not use AWS RDS anymore because I was using a school account. So, I used ClearDB to build my app using native MySQL databases instead. In class, I used Laravel version 6 and PHP 7 but upgraded Laravel version to 8 and PHP version to 8.1 after the course ended.

## Technologies Used
- Laravel - version 8.0
- PHP - version 8.1
- MySQL
- ClearDB
- Heroku

## Features
- A users admin page that lists all users and provides buttons to perform required actions on users. (Show, Edit, Delete)
- A create user page that provides fields for creating a new user as well as a field to tie a user to one or more of the available roles.
- An edit page that allows modifications to an existing user
- The capability to delete a user via Soft Deleting
-	A themes admin page that lists all users and provides buttons to perform required actions on users. (Show, Edit, Delete)
-	A create theme page that provides fields for creating a new theme.
-	An edit page that allows modifications to an existing theme.
